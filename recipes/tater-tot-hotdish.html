  <h1>Directions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)
    </li>
    <li>
      Set a large deep cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.  Add olive oil and swirl to coat skillet evenly.  Add onions to skillet in one even layer; top with ground beef, breaking it up into small pieces.  Cook undisturbed until onions are translucent, about 2 minutes.  Stir beef and onions until well combined and cook until beef is cooked through and browned, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes longer
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduce heat to medium.  Season beef with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.  Cook, stirring often, for 1 more minute.  Remove from heat.  Add cream of mushroom soup, green beans, and corn; stir until well combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      Toss tater tots and seasoned salt in a bowl to combine.  Arrange tater tots decoratively over beef mixture in the skillet, avoiding large gaps between tater tots.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in preheated oven until tater tots are golden and crisp, about 1 hour.  Sprinkle with cheese and scallions; cool 10 minutes before serving.
